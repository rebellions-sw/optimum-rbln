    The Phi Model transformer with a language modeling head (linear layer) on top.
    This model inherits from [`RBLNDecoderOnlyModelForCausalLM`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the library implements for all its models.

    A class to convert and run pre-trained transformers based PhiForCausalLM model on RBLN devices.
    It implements the methods to convert a pre-trained transformers PhiForCausalLM model into a RBLN transformer model by:
    - transferring the checkpoint weights of the original into an optimized RBLN graph,
    - compiling the resulting graph using the RBLN compiler.
