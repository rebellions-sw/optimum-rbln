class ModernBertModelWrapper(torch.nn.Module):
    """Compilation wrapper for ModernBERT encoder models.

    Like the generic `TransformerEncoderWrapper`, this wrapper passes the 2D
    padding `attention_mask` through unchanged. ModernBERT uses alternating
    full / local (sliding-window) attention and builds its two 4D masks
    internally via `create_bidirectional_mask` and
    `create_bidirectional_sliding_window_mask`. Pre-expanding the mask here
    would feed the same global mask to the sliding layers and drop the local
    windowing, producing incorrect outputs.

    `return_dict` is forced off so the traced graph exposes a single `logits`
    tensor; the RBLN runtime rebuilds the `MaskedLMOutput` from it.
