    The Exaone Model transformer with a language modeling head on top (linear layer with weights tied to the input
    embeddings).

    This model inherits from [`RBLNDecoderOnlyModelForCausalLM`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model.

    It implements the methods to convert a pre-trained transformers Exaone model into a RBLN transformer model by:
    - transferring the checkpoint weights of the original into an optimized RBLN graph,
    - compiling the resulting graph using the RBLN compiler.
